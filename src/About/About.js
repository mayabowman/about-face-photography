      <p>Thanks for taking a minute to read this. Iâ€™m a photographer focusing on headshots
        and portraits for the individual trying to make their way and be acknowledged.
        For the person needing to be seen for what they can bring to a situation, a community, a life.
        This means listening, vision, and some good lighting go a long way towards proving potential.
        A portrait is a capsule of the potential of character.  What a photo session offers is an
        exchange of perspectives on character. And if a camera can capture that exchange,
        it is truly a gift.</p>
