    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>Thanks for taking a minute to read this. Iâ€™m a Midwest photographer focusing on
      headshots and portraits for the individual trying to make their way, be acknowledged,
      and be seen for what they can bring to a situation, a community, a life.
      This means listening, vision, and some good lighting go a long way towards proving potential,
      of which a portrait is a capsule. What a photo session offers is an exchange of perspectives
      on character. And if a camera can capture that exchange, it is truly a gift.</p>
